# Recycle.Me
Recycle.Me is an app made to encourage recycling. It allows its users to register, login and preview news, but its main purpose is collecting points with which they can buy coupons. Users can get points by bringing recyclable material to recycling centers. Coupons are actually discounts that can be used in sponsors shops.
There is also worker mode for users that have worker credentials. In this mode user-worker can send specific number of points to other users. Administrators can give/take worker credentials to/from a specific user. 

Coupons spending feature is planned to work in conjoins with sponsors shop systems.
